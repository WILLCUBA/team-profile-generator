## Usage
As a manager of a team, you would enjoy using this application to generate a webpage that displays your team's basic information <br/>
To use this application, clone the repository to your local machine:
```
Then, ensure you install the dependencies with command:
```
npm install
```
When you're ready to run the application, from the root folder, type the below into your command line:
```
node index
```

Once the application runs, it will generate an index.html file in the "dist" folder. If you already have an index.html file in that folder, it will first prompt you to overwrite it or not.
